# My First 2D Game Project

> This is my first attempt at developing a game using the latest version of Unity. Since 2015, I have been interested in game development, but at that time, I didn't have all the necessary requirements to pursue it further. However, now I am excited to make a comeback and create my own version of Flappy Bird.

> **Flappy Bird** is a mobile game developed by Dong Nguyen, a Vietnamese video game artist and programmer. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through columns of green pipes without colliding with them.
